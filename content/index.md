We're on a mission to empower entrepreneurs to build world-class internet products from Kerala!

KPH Fund provides seed capital and support to early-stage startups in Kerala. We partner with founders to refine their product strategy and go-to-market approach, helping them to build global products from Kerala.

Our community includes Y Combinator alumni and experienced founders who have successfully built and scaled products for international markets.
