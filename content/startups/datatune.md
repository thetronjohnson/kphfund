### Quick Pitch:
Datatune is building the unified data operations platform that solves the critical bottleneck in AI/ML development - managing and processing massive datasets efficiently. Founded by core contributors to industry-leading ML tools like Keras (60K+ GitHub stars), the team is uniquely positioned to address the growing pain points in large-scale AI training workflows.

### Founder Story & Why They're Special:
The founding team brings rare technical credibility in the ML infrastructure space. CTO Fariz Rahman is a core contributor to Keras, Activeloop, and Weights & Biases - some of the most widely used ML tools globally. CEO Abhijith Neil Abraham has built popular open-source ML tools (TableQA) and has deep expertise across biomedical AI and ML infrastructure, having mentored 5000+ developers. Their combined experience building developer tools used by millions uniquely positions them to solve this critical problem.

### Problem & Solution:
AI teams waste significant time and resources managing scattered datasets across multiple storage systems (S3, Azure, Huggingface, etc.) and dealing with processing bottlenecks when training large models. Datatune provides a unified interface to aggregate, manage, and stream data directly from sources, with built-in labeling and transformation capabilities. Their SDK enables efficient batch streaming and parallel processing, significantly reducing the compute resources and time required for large-scale AI training.

### Market Size & Opportunity:
With the explosive growth in AI development and increasing model sizes, efficient data infrastructure is becoming critical. The ML data infrastructure market is projected to grow rapidly as more enterprises build and deploy AI models, presenting a massive opportunity for a solution that simplifies this complex workflow.

### Current Traction & Key Metrics:
- 6 beta customers with 3 paying customers, including the creator of OpenBioLLM (ranked #1 in biomedical domain)
- Early enterprise interest with individual developer contracts at $10/month
- Pipeline of potential enterprise contracts at $20,000/month
- Strong product validation from technical users building production AI systems

### Fundraising Goals & Use of Funds:
Raising $300K to:
- Expand free trial program to accelerate customer acquisition
- Strengthen US market presence and sales efforts
- Continue product development and infrastructure scaling

### Why Now is the Right Time:
The exponential growth in AI development and increasing model sizes has created an urgent need for efficient data infrastructure. Current solutions are fragmented and complex, while Datatune's unified approach addresses a critical pain point as more organizations scale their AI efforts. The team's technical credibility and early customer validation demonstrate product-market fit at the right moment in the market's evolution.

The combination of deep technical expertise, early customer validation, and perfect market timing makes Datatune an compelling investment opportunity in the rapidly growing AI infrastructure space.
