### Quick Pitch:
BrowserAgents is an open-source synthetic monitoring platform that uniquely bridges the gap between testing and monitoring by leveraging existing QA automation scripts. Built by the founder of PerfAgents (#1 Synthetic Monitoring tool on AWS Marketplace), BrowserAgents aims to democratize application monitoring through an open-source approach, enabling both QA teams and DevOps to use the same tools for testing and monitoring.

### Founder Story:
Ajith Joseph is a technical founder with deep expertise in cloud infrastructure, holding certifications in Kubernetes, Azure, and AWS. As the founder of PerfAgents, he successfully built and scaled a B2B SaaS platform while handling both technical development and enterprise sales. His unique combination of technical depth and commercial acumen has led to the insight that the synthetic monitoring market needs an open-source revolution to achieve product-led growth.

### Problem & Solution:
Traditional synthetic monitoring tools require separate tooling and expertise from testing frameworks, creating inefficiencies and increased costs for organizations. BrowserAgents solves this by allowing companies to repurpose their existing automated tests for monitoring, supporting popular frameworks like Selenium, Puppeteer, Cypress, and Playwright. This dual-use approach significantly reduces setup time, costs, and complexity while improving application reliability.

### Market Size & Opportunity:
The synthetic monitoring market is projected to grow significantly as organizations increasingly rely on complex digital applications. The shift towards open-source tools in the developer ecosystem presents a unique opportunity to capture market share through a product-led growth strategy, similar to successful open-source companies like MongoDB and Elastic.

### Current Traction:
- PerfAgents has generated $520K in services revenue
- Secured first fintech customer with $4K ARR
- Ranked #1 Synthetic Monitoring solution on AWS Marketplace
- Strong technical validation through AWS partnership

### Fundraising Goals:
Seeking $250K to:
- Launch and market BrowserAgents as an open-source platform
- Implement product-led growth strategy
- Expand partnerships with service companies
